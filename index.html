            Hello, my name is Harris and I have done my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering in 2022. During my bachelor's degree, I was appointed as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Transportation Planning & Engineering Course for Spring 2022 semester in which I designed a Complex Engineering Project on 4-step Transportation Planning Model. After completing my undergraduate study, I have conducted research for 1 year as a Research Assistant (RA) on “Measuring the 15-minute city in Lahore, Pakistan”. Currently, I am employed as a Transportation Engineer in a private firm named Sheher Saaz Pvt. Ltd. where I have worked on various city-level mobility plans and regional connectivity plans in Pakistan. Moving forward with my career, I hope to pursue higher education at a renowned university for a doctorate degree in Transportation Engineering to continue my passion to improve Urban Transportation Systems.
